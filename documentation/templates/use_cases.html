			Example 1
		</h2>
		<p>
			Toaster let's you and your neighbor know it's on fire. Your toaster puts your security system in emergency mode because it has permissions to do that. Then your neighbor is able to enter your house because you gave them permission to do so under emergency conditions. Your neighbor uses their relationship to gain access.
		</p>
		<p>
			Emergency button on your phone could also put your house in anonymous access mode to allow ambulance workers to enter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Locate your remote control by proximity. You are friends with your remote, you are also friends with your couch. You can see the friend your remote has the lowest ping time with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Warranty registration automation. This could allow a situation where your friend is shopping and sees an item you've registered for the warranty with. The item would have a relationship with the manufacturer. The manufacturer would determine your friend is looking at the same item. Thus, show your the information your friend has about that item. Establishing temporary relationships to gather relevant information. Just analyze how your graphs compare. Marketing capabilities.

		</p>
		<h2>
			Example 2

		</h2>

			Car to car social networking for self-driving cars. Exchanging sensor data between vehicles. Relaying relevant sensor data from vehicles no longer present but if they became present again, we would want to know it was the same vehicle that was relayed as a 2nd degree connection. Maybe it could be a p2p / cloud mix depending on latency, connectivity.
