yadapy is a python implementation of the Yada Project Protocol.


What is the Yada Project Protocol?

The Yada Project Protocol allows you to host your identity on any device capable of sending, receiving and storing data. Once hosted, you are able to create relationships and communicate with other identities hosted elsewhere on the internet.  


Features / Capabilities:
---
- Identity Management (Kind of like web hosting, only you're hosting identities instead of web sites.)
- O-Auth style authentication
- Automatic account registration
- Ability to create a social graph spanning multiple web sites
- Web Service management by creating relationships with end points
- Enhanced control over privacy
